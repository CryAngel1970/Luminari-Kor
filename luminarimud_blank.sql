Be warned that the bards\njack of all trades nature does not make it the strongest solo class\nand a bard is strongest when providing utility and support to a group.\n	n\n	RChoosing ability scores	n\nThe list below sorts abilities into three levels of importance: high,\nmedium and low. Please keep in mind these recommendations do not take\ninto account any future multi-classing prerequisites and are only general\nadvice, there is no right and wrong way to build your character.\nStr - Low - While strength is useful for combat, you should prioritise\ndex and con for the reasons listed below.\nDex - Med - Essential to accommodate light armor. If you plan to be melee\n  this will also be used for weapon finesse (feat info weapon finesse)\nCon - Med - The Bard has a poor fortitude save and extra hit-points come\n  in very handy.\nInt - Low - Bards dont use intelligence to cast and already get a high\n  number of training sessions. That being said, they can always use more.\nWis - Low - Not important as its only used for will saves and the Bard\n  already has good willpower save progression.\nChr - High - The most essential stat for a bard.

Combat in Luminari \r\nis multi-layered and is designed for a fast-paced, active experience.  \r\n \r\nInitiating Combat:\r\nCombat can be initiated in a couple ways.  The most usual way to initate combat \r\nis to use the kill or hit commands : kill <name> or hit <name>.  This will \r\ninitiate combat between you and the specified mobile or player.  If\r\nyou have a Combat Maneuver (CM) in the attack queue, that CM will be used \r\ninstead of a melee attack.\r\nCombat may also be initiated via a CM, trip for example : trip <name>.  This \r\ncommand will initiate combat with a trip CM.\r\n \r\nCombat Rounds:\r\nThe combat round lasts 6 seconds, divided into 3 2-second phases.  The attacks \r\nin your attack rotation (help ATTACKS) are divided up between these phases in \r\nthe following way:\r\n \r\nPhase 1: attacks 1, 4, 7\r\nPhase 2: attacks 2, 5, 8\r\nPhase 3: attacks 3, 6, 9\r\n \r\nYou can check the number of attacks you have in your rotation by using the ATTACKS \r\ncommand.  The number of attacks available is directly based on your Base Attack\r\nBonus (BAB), which increases based on your class and level.\r\n \r\nActions in Combat:\r\nCombat is directly affected by the actions you have available.  If you have \r\nboth a standard action and a move action available, you will automatically \r\nperform a full attack every combat round, utilizing your entire attack rotation.\r\nIf you have only a standard action, then only attacks in the first phase will be \r\nperformed.  If your character has neither a move nor a standard action, no \r\nattacks will be made in this round.  See ''help ACTIONS'' for more information.\r\n \r\nCombat Modes:\r\nThere are a number of combat modes available that change the way you fight.  \r\nSome modes are always available and some are unlocked by feats.  Knowing when to\r\nuse the different modes is vital for mastering combat.  see ''help COMBAT-MODES''\r\nfor more information.\r\n \r\nAttacks of Opportunity:\r\nSometimes a combatant in a melee lets his guard down or takes a reckless action. \r\nIn this case, combatants engaged to this combatant can take advantage of his \r\nlapse in defense to attack him for free. These free attacks are called attacks \r\nof opportunity, and are marked 	W[	RAOO	W]	n next to the attack.  Usually, you\r\nare able to make one Attack of opportunity (AOO) every 6 seconds.  If you have\r\nthe Combat Reflexes feat, however, you may make a number of Attacks of \r\nopportunity equal to your dexterity bonus every 6 seconds. See ''help AAO'' for\r\nmore information\r\n \r\nCombat Maneuvers:\r\nDuring combat, you can attempt to perform a number of maneuvers that can hinder \r\nor even cripple your foe.  Many of these attacks can be used in place of a \r\nmelee attack, allowing you to combine different combat maneuvers together to \r\nstack bonuses on your allies or penalties on your enemies.  Some maneuvers may\r\ntrigger an AOO from your opponents.  See ''help COMBAT-MANEUVERS'' for more \r\ninformation.\r\n \r\nSee Also: COMBAT-MANEUVERS, ATTACK-QUEUE, ACTION-QUEUE, ACTIONS, COMBAT-MODES, AOO\r\n', 0, '2019-12-17 16:55:55'),

('dependent', 'ZEDIT-DEPENDENT DEPENDANT ZEDIT-DEPENDANT', '   One of the most common mistakes by new builders is their misunderstanding\nof: "Is this command dependent on the success of the previous one? (y/n)."\nWhat this is asking is: does it rely on the command preceding it? Or do you\nonly want this to execute when the line prior to it does. For example if you \nare giving an object to a mob, equipping a mob, or putting something inside \nan object, IT MUST BE DEPENDENT on that mob/obj first loading. So you\nshould answer yes. IF you are loading a mob, closing a door or loading an\nobject to a room it would normally not be. There are too many instances to\ndescribe every one so try to use common sense. When loading an object to a\nmob maxload should be 99. Since the equip or give option in zedit will be\ndependent on the mob first loading only 1 item will be given when it loads.\nUnlike the load to room command where you should not set a maxload of 99\nbecause 99 objects will load to that room.\n\nSee also: MAXLOAD, ZEDIT-ADVANCED\n', 31, '2014-09-25 11:41:57'),
('describing', '', '   Writing good descriptions requires inspiration and imagination before all \nelse. There is nothing particularly difficult about writing for a MUD, but \nthere are a number of common, fatal mistakes new builders typically make. If\nyou read through this tutorial, you should be able to avoid the common \npitfalls, and thus insure a long life as a builder.\n   Remember that your job with descriptions is to create an interactive \nenvironment that the player sees, hears, feels, etc. This means that your \nnumber one goal is to be eloquently descriptive. \n   Writing for a MUD was once explained to me as writing a story for the \nmortals of the realm. As you go through the zone, it unfolds into different \ntwists in the plot. Try imagining writing a small book when creating your \ndescriptions. A few builders wing it, which I highly discourage. The best \nzones I have ever seen have always had much forethought and planning before\nthe builder process began. Do what works best for you, everyone has their own\nstyle of building. Use it to your advantage.\n   Use adjectives. Sad, Angry, Dirty, Nice, Morose, Gleeful, Enraged, Filthy,\nPleasant, Melancholy, Ecstatic, Pestilent, Comfortable, Depressing, Blissful,\nSpiteful, Smutty, etc. A thesaurus is great for this. 	Chttp://m-w.com/	n\n   An interesting area will always attract more players than a bland one.  \nThere are many ways to make an area interesting.  Try to be as descriptive as\npossible.  Do not hold back on writing extra descriptions.  Players are so\naccustomed to not having richly described areas that finding an extra\ndescription can often be a real treat.  Also, one oft forgotten thing to\ndescribe is the door exits.  Describing all of these can give a feel of\nstanding out in a field and seeing something like: To the north there appears\nto be a plume of smoke.  The fields stretch off towards the large hills on the\nhorizon.    \n   Many players (both experienced and first timers) read the descriptions\ncarefully the first time they walk through an area, and having many extra\ndescriptions helps them fill out their idea of what things actually look like.\n   When writing the numerous descriptions of the area, make them interesting \nto read! Nobody likes to read room after room of stupid one-line descriptions. \nVary each description as much as possible. One of the greatest joys for most \nplayers is finding new and interesting rooms, items, treasures, and monsters. \nFor those of you familiar with role-playing games, this creative use of \ndescriptions and atmosphere should be quite well known to you. Consider \nlooking over other areas you enjoy before building your own, to use ideas from\nthat area. Remember: You do not want to bore your players to tears.\n   There are four types of descriptions a builder can make. Room, Mob, Obj and\nextra. Room descriptions are simply what players see when they walk into a room.\nMob and Obj descriptions are what players see when they look at the Mob or Obj.\nExtra descriptions are unique because they can be used on either rooms or\nobjects and can be seen when a player types "look <keyword>".\n\nSee also: REDIT-DESC, REDIT-EXTRA, OEDIT-EXTRA, MEDIT-D-DESC\n', 31, '2014-09-25 11:41:57'),

To simplify things they \nhave all been included in this help file along with how to correct them.\n\n1: Errant Rooms\n------------\n 1: [ 1233] Rumble''s Room\n\n   The most common are exits to 0 (the void). This happens when a builder \nmodifies a room exit but does not include an exit room vnum. These errant \nrooms are listed by the command ''show error'' The fix is simple, remove the \nexit by purge exit in redit exit menu or by using ''dig <direction> -1''\n\n2: SYSERR: Object # (oedit-s-desc) doesn''t have drink type as last keyword. (oedit-keyword)\n\n   Another common error is caused by how shop code handles drink containers \npoorly. In order for shops to display a jug as a jug of <drink type> they \nmust have the drink type as the last keyword. It is good practice to put the \ndrink type as the first and last word of an objects keyword (older versions \nof CircleMUD expect it first).\ni.e. a shot of whisky should have the keyword: whisky shot whisky\n     a cup of slime mold juice keyword should be: juice cup slime juice\n\n3: SYSERR: Mob #5 both Aggressive and Aggressive_to_Alignment.\n\n   Another harmless error. If your mob is aggressive there is no need to also\nmake it aggressive to certain alignments since AGGR means it will attack any\nplayer it can see. Choose to make it aggressive to an alignment or aggressive \nto all.\n \n4: SYSERR: Object # (oedit-s-desc) has out of range level #.\n\n   A simple one. Limit spell levels to the levels available, on TBA that would \nbe 1-34.\n\n5: SYSERR: Object # (oedit-s-desc) has negative weight (-2147483644).\n   SYSERR: Object # (oedit-s-desc) has out of range level #2147483647.\n\n   These are really annoying. This happens when you use numbers larger than \nnecessary. \n\n6: SYSERR: Object # (oedit-s-desc) uses ''UNDEFINED'' spell #.\n\n   There is no spell zero. Either select a spell or put -1 for none. \n\n7: SYSERR: Object # (oedit-s-desc) contains (5) more than maximum (3).\n\n   When making a drink container you will set how much it initially contains \non creation and the max it can hold if a player were to fill it. Common sense \ntells us that you can not create a container that initially holds more than \nthe max you set. To simplify the max must always be greater than or equal to \nthe initial amount.\n\n8: Char is already equipped: (medit-s-desc), (oedit-s-desc)\n\n   This happens when someone tries to equip a mob with one or more object in\na single location. HELP ZEDIT-EQUIP for all the possible object equipping \nlocations. All you have to do to fix this is pick a different equip location\nthat is not used. \n\nSee also: TRIG-ERRORS, ZEDIT-MISTAKES, SEDIT-MISTAKES\n', 31, '2014-09-25 11:41:57'),

In order for variety to emerge, the Infinite Eternal, or Father God of the gods, withdrew his being from an\nimmense sphere, creating space. His essence remained, however, filling the emptiness.

A man cannot teach a fish to make fire. The gods are made of the essence of eterna\n concepts, including everything from emotions like anger and love, to elements like fire and water, to laws of the universe like gravity and electromagnetism.\n\nMany gods never contact or influence mortals in any way. Some are aware of their true nature as fragments of the Inifinite Eternal, and seek eventual reunification. Others seek more mundane causes, like scientific or magical progress, while others seek t\n reduce suffering.\nSome gods have become opposites of the infinite goodness of their creator, being comprised of rebellion, treachery, cowardice, cruelty, hunger, doubt, and so on. Every attribute in existence has its just place, but these gods have become warped and seek \nvil and darkness.\nAs part of the infancy of the gods, they created the worlds and all beings that inhabit them, each race showing the hand of its creators. Gods of magic and music created the elves, gods of stone and wisdom created the dwarves, and so on. Some races worsh\np a single god, others many. Some races and cultures honor the gods, but only worship the Infinite Eternal.\nThe mortal world serves almost as a nexus of the universe (albeit one of many) where many of the powers and gods in existence seek to advance themselves and their cause. This is the source of all conflict in the universe--until mortals learn the true bal\nnce of all attributes and become perfectly unified, there will be imbalance and conflict.\nThe attention and influence of these immensely powerful beings is the source of arcane magic, which is drawn to the world almost by gravity, drawn to earth by their awareness, for the focused and conscious mind to manipulate.

Goto http://m-w.com/ for a thesaurus.\n	n   I have found that a good principle to make is to avoid the use of all \ncontractions. For example, if you mean to say "it is", do not use "it''s", spell\nit out. This will help differentiate between "its" which means ''belonging to \nit'' and "it is". Another set of problem words to take note of is the \n"they''re", "there", and "their". The first can be avoided because it is a \ncontraction, the second is not here, but there, and the final one means that \nit belongs to them. One final instance to take note of are "to", "too", and \n"two". The first is used when you want to say something like ''the passage \nleads to there'', the second should be used in situations where there is an\nexcess of something, such as ''too much red paint was used to cover the walls \nthere''. The final one is the number 2 (two).\n	n   As far as obscenity in descriptions is concerned, we have no problem with \nusing it in humor or description.

Whether a half-elf was raised by their human parent\r\nor their elven parent, they often felt isolated and alone. Because they took\r\naround twenty years to reach adulthood, they matured quickly when raised by\r\nelves (who think they look like humans), making them feel like an outsider in\r\neither place. Most half-elves were descended from moon elves. Pairings of elves\r\nand other races also existed, though they were rare. Half elves stood roughly\r\naround 5 feet 5 inches to six feet two inches (1.65 - 1.88 meters), making them\r\nonly slightly shorter overall than humans, and weighed in at 130 - 190 lbs. (59\r\n- 86 kg), making them heavier than elves but still considerably lighter than\r\nhumans. Like humans, half-elves had a wide variety of complexions, some of which\r\nwere inherited from the elven half of their heritage, such as a tendency for\r\nmetallic-hued skin and inhuman hair colors. Unlike true Tel''Quessir, however,\r\nmale half-elves were capable of growing facial hair and often did so to\r\ndistinguish themselves, in part, from their elven parents. Half-elven ears were\r\nabout the size of human ones, but like elves, they were pointed on the ends.\r\nHalf-elves were also notably more durable and passionate than either elves or\r\nhumans, a unique result of the two races'' blending. \r\n	n\r\n	G>Racial Abilities:	n\r\n	n\r\n	WInfravision:	n             - Can detect life forms in the dark.\r\n	WHalf Blood:	n              - +2 to discipline and lore skills.\r\n	WAdaptability:	n            - 20 percent chance per skill check for +3 bonus, and 5% bonus to all exp gains.\r\n	WEnchantment Resistance:	n  - +2 to saves vs. enchantment.\r\n	WKeen Senses:	n             - +2 to perception and sense motive skills.\r\n	WSleep immunity:	n          - Immune to sleep based enchantments.\r\n	WElven Weapons:	n           - Proficient in long swords, rapiers and all types of bows.\r\n	n\r\n	G>Ability Adjustments:  	W +2 Cha and 2 extra stat points when choosing ability scores 	n\r\n	n\r\n	G>Experience Modifier:  	W None 	n\r\n	n\r\n	YSee also:	n RACES\r\n	n\r\n', 0, '2022-11-01 22:29:13'),

This file contains the text of the CircleMUD license. \nIf you wish to use the CircleMUD system in any way, or use any of its source code, \nyou must read this license and are legally bound to comply with it. \n\nCircleMUD is a derivative work based on the DikuMUD system written by Hans Henrik \nStaerfeldt, Katja Nyboe, Tom Madsen, Michael Seifert, and Sebastian Hammer. DikuMUD \nis also licensed software; you are legally bound to comply with the original DikuMUD \nlicense as well as the CircleMUD license if you wish to use CircleMUD. \n\nUse of the CircleMUD code in any capacity implies that you have read, understood, and \nagreed to abide by the terms and conditions set down by this license and the DikuMUD \nlicense. If you use CircleMUD without complying with the license, you are breaking \nthe law. \n\nUsing CircleMUD legally is easy. In short, the license requires three things: \n\n\nYou must not use CircleMUD to make money or be compensated in any way. \nYou must give the authors credit for their work. \nYou must comply with the DikuMUD license. \nThat''s it -- those are the main conditions set down by this license. Unfortunately, \npast experience has shown that many people are not willing to follow the spirit of \nthe license, so the remainder of this document will clearly define those conditions \nin an attempt to prevent people from circumventing them. \n\nThe first condition says that you must not use CircleMUD to make money in any way or \nbe otherwise compensated. CircleMUD was developed in people''s uncompensated spare \ntime and was given to you free of charge, and you must not use it to make money. \nCircleMUD must not in any way be used to facilitate your acceptance of fees, \ndonations, or other compensation. Examples include, but are not limited to the \nfollowing: \n\n\nIf you run CircleMUD, you must not require any type of fee or donation in exchange \nfor being able to play CircleMUD. You must not solicit, offer or accept any kind of \ndonation from your players in exchange for enhanced status in the game such as \nincreased levels, character stats, gold, or equipment. \n\nYou must not solicit or accept money or other donations in exchange for running \nCircleMUD. You must not accept money or other donations from your players for \npurposes such as hardware upgrades for running CircleMUD. \n\nYou must not sell CircleMUD. You must not accept any type of fee in exchange for \ndistributing or copying CircleMUD. \n\nIf you are a CircleMUD administrator, You must not accept any type of reimbursement \nfor money spent out of pocket for running CircleMUD, i.e., for equipment expenses or \nfees incurred from service providers. \n\nThe second part of the license states that you must give credit to the creators of \nCircleMUD. A great deal of work went into the creation of CircleMUD, and it was given \nto you completely free of charge; claiming that you wrote the MUD yourself is a slap \nin the face to everyone who worked to bring you a high quality product while asking \nfor nothing but credit for their work in return. \nSpecifically, the following are required: \n\n\nThe text in the ''credits'' file distributed with CircleMUD must be preserved. You may \nadd your own credits to the file, but the existing text must not be removed, \nabridged, truncated, or changed in any way. This file must be displayed when the \n''credits'' command is used from within the MUD. \n\nThe "CIRCLEMUD" help entry must be maintained intact and unchanged, and displayed in \nits entirety when the ''help circlemud'' command is used. \n\nThe login sequence must contain the names of the DikuMUD and CircleMUD creators. The \n''login sequence'' is defined as the text seen by players between the time they connect \nto the MUD and when they start to play the game itself. \n\nThis license must be distributed AS IS with all copies or portions of the CircleMUD \nthat you distribute, if any, including works derived from CircleMUD. \n\nYou must not remove, change, or modify any notices of copyright, licensing or \nauthorship found in any CircleMUD source code files. \n\nClaims that any of the above requirements are inapplicable to a particular MUD for \nreasons such as "our MUD is totally rewritten" or similar are completely invalid. If \nyou can write a MUD completely from scratch then you are encouraged to do so by all \nmeans, but use of any part of the CircleMUD or DikuMUD source code requires that \ntheir respective licenses be followed, including the crediting requirements. \n\nThe third part of the license simply states that you must comply with the DikuMUD \nlicense. This is required because CircleMUD is a DikuMUD derivative. The DikuMUD \nlicense is included below. \nYou are allowed to use, modify and redistribute all CircleMUD source code and \ndocumentation as long as such use does not violate any of the rules set down by this \nlicense. \n\nJeremy Elson \n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEverything below this line is the original, unmodified DikuMUD license.

DikuMud is NOT Public Domain, shareware, careware or the like !!\n\n   You may under no circumstances make profit on *ANY* part of DikuMud in\n   any possible way. You may under no circumstances charge money for\n   distributing any part of dikumud - this includes the usual $5 charge\n   for "sending the disk" or "just for the disk" etc.\n   By breaking these rules you violate the agreement between us and the\n   University, and hence will be sued.\n\n   You may not remove any copyright notices from any of the documents or\n   sources given to you.\n\n   This license must *always* be included "as is" if you copy or give\n   away any part of DikuMud (which is to be done as described in this\n   document).\n\n   If you publish *any* part of dikumud, we as creators must appear in the\n   article, and the article must be clearly copyrighted subject to this\n   license. Before publishing you must first send us a message, by\n   snail-mail or e-mail, and inform us what, where and when you are\n   publishing (remember to include your address, name etc.)\n\n   If you wish to setup a version of DikuMud on any computer system, you\n   must send us a message , by snail-mail or e-mail, and inform us where\n   and when you are running the game. (remember to include \n   your address, name etc.)\n\n\n   Any running version of DikuMud must include our names in the login\n   sequence. Furthermore the "credits" command shall always cointain\n   our name, addresses, and a notice which states we have created DikuMud.\n\n   You are allowed to alter DikuMud, source and documentation as long as\n   you do not violate any of the above stated rules.\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\n\nThe DikuMud Group\n\n\nNote:\n\nWe hope you will enjoy DikuMud, and encourage you to send us any reports\non bugs (when you find ''it''). Remember that we are all using our spare\ntime to write and improve DikuMud, bugs, etc. - and changes will take their\ntime. We have so far put extremely many programming hours into this project.\nIf you make any major improvements on DikuMud we would be happy to\nhear from you. As you will naturally honor the above rules, you will receive\nnew updates and improvements made to the game.\n\n \n===================================================================\n=========== End Document ==========================================\n===================================================================\n\nSee also: CREDITS ZLIST TBAMUD CIRCLEMUD\n', 0, '2014-09-25 11:41:57'),

('locations', '', '   It is very important to know where an area is going to fit in with the world\nbefore it is written. This may seem very obvious, but it is a painful truth\nthat many people make areas without regard for where they will be placed on the\nMUD. A character should not be walking around in an idyllic happy forest and\nsuddenly come upon an arctic wilderness.  Likewise a character should not\nventure a couple steps outside a main human city and find themselves in an\nancient elven homeland. Plan where your new area is going to go and make sure \nit does not grievously conflict with surrounding terrain, climate, politics, \nmythology, and races. \n   The best thing to do, of course, is to integrate your zone seamlessly with\nthe rest of the world rather than allowing for one connecting point and sealing\nthe zone off from its surroundings in all other directions. It is not easy to\ndo this, and it is not always even possible. But it is worth spending some time\nworking on the rooms that link the zone as you first conceived it.\n   If it is a city, the main gates probably are going to open out onto an\nexisting road, not into the middle of a forest.  Give some thought to using a\nfew rooms to link the "main" part of your area to a spot that is already in the\nMUD (be creative - as well as roads and pathways, there are waterways and other\nmeans to reach places). If it is more of a wilderness-type area, then the way\nit links might be a bit more vague, and it might link in more than one place - \nwhen was the last time you saw a forest, field, or desert that could only be \nreached in one way? As important as where the zone should begin is where it \nshould end. A city or even a village might have walls and a logical "edge," \nbut if you are working with wilderness or even just the surroundings beyond \nthe city itself, it is hard to know where and how to draw the boundaries.\nNatural formations seem like the perfect answer -- rivers, mountains, and so\non -- BUT (and I think this is a huge but) the problem with these is that they\nare extremely prominent geographical features and are not a good "throwaway"\nsolution.  \n   If you are writing forest room upon forest room and think you will never get\nto the end, do not just write in an insurmountable mountain range or a \ngratuitous river.  That will lead to questions like, "What is on the other \nside of the mountains, and why can not I approach them or even see them from\nanywhere else?" or "Why did this river suddenly come to an abrupt end as soon \nas I left this forest?" Far better is to do something on a smaller scale -- the\ntrees just get too dense to move on... do not assume that your area has only \none or two points of entry. Try and make your area accessible from at least \ntwo different points, preferably in different directions. Try and leave at \nleast one possible exit on each "side" of your area in case something needs \nto be linked to it later. \n   TBA allows builders to create whatever their hearts desire and we have no \nMUDwide theme. Because of this your zone will be isolated from all others and \nshould be designed to be added easily into any MUD. For location you should\nplan the geographic environment: Forest, tundra, city, port, etc.\n\n', 31, '2014-09-25 11:41:57'),

What it means by max allowed is simply if this many exists on the \nmud, do not load anymore. So if you want 1 shopkeeper. Set it to one. If you \nwant 10 Kobolds set it to 10. The same goes for objects. In both cases never\nput a max of over 99. This is just a good practice and prevents 1000''s of the\nsame mobs or objects making a MUD look generic.\n   Actual mob loading gets a little trickier. Because if you set it to 10 \nKobolds in one room, then every time that zone resets another Kobold will be \nloaded until you have 10 within that one room. So you need to disperse them. \nYou can do this by setting 5 different load mob commands in 5 different rooms.\nAll with a max load of 10. The first time the zone resets. 5 Kobolds will be \nloaded in 5 different rooms. The second time another 5 Kobolds will be loaded \ninto those same rooms. So now you would have 5 rooms with 2 Kobolds in each. \nNext zone reset - nothing changes unless some players come along and kills some\nKobolds.

This is\nleftover from such games as D&D. Where a questmaster determined damage by\nrolling a die. <times to roll>d<size of die>.\n   3d5 means a five sided die will be rolled 3 times. This could give a range\nof results from 3 to 15. An alternate and easier to understand method would be\nto think of the worse and best case scenarios. Example: 5d8. The first number is\nalways the minimum damage: 5. Because worse case scenario would be rolling ones\nevery time. The best case scenario, or max damage, is simply 5 times 8. Meaning\nyou roll eights every time: 40. So 5d8 gives 5-40 damage. 6d7 means 6-42. 4d5\nis 4-20 points damage.\n   The question often comes up as to what damage a weapon should inflict. I \nwill attempt to explain. To understand damage you first need to know hitpoints.\nA player starts with 10 hitpoints. Then they gain a certain amount depending on\ntheir class when they level. Stock tbaMUD uses the following: Wizards\ngain 3-8, Clerics 5-10, Rogues 7-13, Warriors 10-15. So a level 1 Warrior\nwill have 20-25 hitpoints. Now, let us apply common sense. A weapon that does\n25 points of damage could kill a level 1 player in one hit. While a weapon with\na damage of 1-2 points (1d2) would allow for several rounds of combat and a \nchance to flee. A level 30 warrior would have 310-460 hitpoints. So a weapon\nwith damage of 50 would be okay. That is why we suggest 50 as max weapon damage.\nTo keep things simple I would suggest weapons only do damage equal or double to\nthe players level.  \n\n   Average damage is calculated by this formula: ((DAMDICE + 1)/2) X NUMDICE\n4d5 = ((5+1)/2) X 4 = 3 X 4 = 12 points average damage. Which makes sense \nsince 4d5 would give damage between 4-20.\n\nSee also: STANDARDS, %DAMAGE%\n', 31, '2014-09-25 11:41:57'),

('oedit-extra-descriptions', 'OEDIT-EXTRAS', 'E) Extra descriptions menu\n   When choosing this option you will be sent to the menu explained under\n	RHELP EXTRA	n. This menu is used for both rooms and objects.\n   Object Extra Descriptions allow players to examine certain aspects of \nobjects defined by the builder, just like Room Extra Descriptions. There can \nbe an unlimited number of Extra Descriptions per object.\n   Take your time on making your objects and use extra descriptions, please!\nFor objects, be very liberal in how you describe them. Remember that a \nplayer''s mental view on an object is based solely on what you tell them \nabout it. There is nothing worse than looking at an object and seeing "The \nsword is big." Yes, this tells the player that it is a sword and it is big, \nbut what else? What color? Is it sharp, notched, dull...? Make your objects \ninteresting. Make your objects personal to the mob that carries them. If you \nmake a cloak that loads on the wizard Throm, make it "The Magic Cloak of \nThrom" or even just "the wizard''s cloak". Anything but just a plain old cloak.\nWhich would you rather have, as a player? When making extra descriptions ensure\nthat all the keywords are covered by the description. Extra descriptions can \nadd small interesting details to your area and are often remembered by players.\nPlease take the time to write extra descriptions. On most MUDs, you can look\nat 100 objects and "You see nothing special..." all 100 times. In an effort to \nmake all MUDs different and better, take the time to write an extra description\nfor your object. Think of an object''s extra description as the same thing as a\nmob''s description when you look at it, which it actually is. For the extra\ndescriptions keywords, use the same keywords as you did earlier. \nA very easy way to detect lazy builders with bad grammar is when objects\nhave no description at all. This causes frustration on the player side, because\nwhen you have seen "You see nothing special..." once too many, you just do not\ntry to look at items anymore. \n   One of the most difficult things you will come across when creating an\nobject is giving it a good description. We all like descriptions, so take a \nlittle time to put your signature on the objects you create. Objects can give\nthe total sense of being within a certain world. They can also give clues as \nto what may lie ahead or what has happened in the past. \n\nSee also: TEXT-EDITOR, EXTRA, SWORDS\n', 31, '2014-09-25 11:41:57'),

We do not need Wizards out there with bonus \nhitpoints on all their eq. \n   Class and Race restrictions are very important. Be sure to know what your \nMUD uses for both and build for them. For example, a Minotaur would not wear \na regular helmet on his head. Minotaurs take pride in their horns, so their\nhorns must be showing. Minotaurs also have hooves for feet.

They are able to fly, have the dodge, weapon finesse and\ninfravision feats and can use the pixie dust and pixie invisibility commands.\n\nPixie dust allows the pixie to cause a specified affect to take place on the\nchosen target.  Options are sleep, charm, confusion, entangle, dispel magic\nand a magical shield. They can use the pixie dust command up to\n4 + their natural charisma score, times per day.\n\nPixie invisibility allows the pixie to cast greater invisibility at will with\nthe pixieinvis command.\n\nThey also have 10 damage reduction and 15 spell resistance.\n\n', 0, '2022-02-24 00:23:35'),

('planning', '', '   There is a wide range of mistakes that builders can make when starting a new\nzone. Zones that have had extensive planning before creation avoid most of \nthese mistakes.\n   Do you know the MUD? Most MUDs are meant for role-players. Do you know what \nthe environment of the MUD is? Have you looked at the zones others have built?\nI would suggest playing a mortal to at least level 10 before attempting to\nbuild anything to get a feel for the realm. Most importantly, have you read the\nbackground story? I was amazed at how few people read the background story.  \nMUDs have themes, and it will always benefit you and the MUD to follow them.  \nThe best builders come to a MUD saying "I can build anything, what does the \nMUD need?"\n   The first thing to do when sitting down to build a zone is just that - sit \ndown and think about it. A zone should always start out on paper long before \nit reaches a MUD. Every zone starts with an idea or a spark. From there, \ndevelop it. Pay attention to what kind of zone theme you want to create. Is it\nmeant to be generic hack and slash experience zone? A wealthy populace to fill\nthe player''s purse with gold? A quest for a special item? The possibilities are\nlimited only by your imagination. The important thing to remember is that zones\nare built for players. Ask yourself, would you want to play in this zone?\n   To help brainstorm I suggest you check out the many different zones \navailable on TBA. All zones are required to have a zone description room in \nthe first vnum of the zone. Goto 1900, 2700, 2900, 20000, 14500, or 15100 for \nsome good examples. Feel free to look at any of the other zones listed under \nshow zone. Beware, some may be unfinished and poor examples. \n   Assign VNUMs to your rooms/mobs/objects beforehand and write them down. Do \nnot try and remember every VNUM you used mentally. Make lists of your mobs and \nobjects. You can always add to the list later. After you have done all this \nyou will already have a huge head start on your zone. Planning will pay off in\nthe long run.\n   All in all, the best way to make an area interesting is to use variety,\nintelligence, and imagination in building. Try to imagine what it would be\nlike for you to walk through and what you might try looking at or doing, and\nthen try to incorporate that into your area. Show your area to others and take\ntheir advice. By taking all of this extra effort in creating your area, you\nwill be rewarded by leaving a lasting memory of your area in the minds of many\nplayers. do not let your area fall by the unfinished wayside!  Work on it a\nlittle every day, even if it is only one or two rooms worth of work. Likewise,\ndo not fill space by just making more of the same mob or duplicate room\ndescriptions. Take your time and do a thorough job, not one that is only \nsuperficially good.    \n   It is recommended that you write out your descriptions on some kind of text\neditor or word processor on your own computer before putting them on a MUD.\nYou can then cut and paste your descriptions in as needed. The advantage to \nthis method is that if you accidentally wipe out your work on the MUD you will\nhave a ready backup. Be careful cutting and pasting to the MUD; if you send too\nmuch text at once you will be disconnected.\n\nSee also: WORK, CARTOGRAPHY, LOCATION, THEME, PLOT, SIZE, ALIGN, BIAS\n', 31, '2014-09-25 11:41:57'),

('plots', '', 'The plot of a zone is the main story of the zone. Such as: hack and slash, \nrescue the princess, find a precious stone, kill the dragon, or forging a \nspecial weapon.   Most builders do not take the possible ecology or economic \neffects of an area into account. By this, I do not mean having a mini-model of \nan actual ecological environment, but rather having things that make the area \nseem more plausible. The best things to put in to make an area more plausible \nare useless objects that actually add atmosphere to the area. Food sources for \nthe mobiles in your area are always necessary to fleshing things out, as are\ncreating import and export goods for cities, complete with customs houses.\n   Your zone should have a strong plot that is incorporated throughout. This\ncan be done by using the different descriptions available. Mobile look\ndescriptions and extra descriptions such as: trails, scrapings on the wall, \netc. Trash objects can be created that are notes or maps.\n   When designing your area and the plots within, you should always consider\nwhat kind of player you want playing in your area. Keep the levels and types\nin mind (i.e. role-playing, power-MUDder, etc). In doing so, try to have fun\nbuilding the area. Make it well rounded and something that you enjoy looking\nthrough afterwards. If you find something you do not like, edit it and change\nit until you like it. It is always best to build when you are not bored of the\narea, since building when you are bored almost always turns out uninspired and\nboring areas.\n   If you are having problems developing a plot try visualizing a story that \nhappens in your zone. For example, say a princess is captured somewhere \nand her relatives are looking for her. Next, you drop some clues to her \nwhereabouts by putting conversations in the looked at description of mobiles. \nYou can set up some mobs so that when you look at them, you get "You strike up\na conversation with the shopkeeper. He chats with you about the rise and fall \nof the price of wheat. Looking at the candy jar he sighs. You ask him why, and\nhe relates a sad tale of how he has not seen a little girl who used to come \ninto his store in a long time." Granted, this is not as elegant as a trigger,\nbut not everyone can write them.    \n   The point is that you interpret the looked at description as something more\nthan just looking, you can view it as a static conversation. You can then go\naround the area and throw in a few room extras leaving a trail to where the\nprincess is. You can also put some extra descriptions on useless items lying\nabout to indicate where one may find the princess. Once at the princess, you\ncould have her relay a story of the location of a secret buried treasure in her\nlooked at description, a nice reward for the rescuing hero. You can set up the\nburied treasure in a hidden container with no long description. Give it a\nshort description of "the ground" so they get the treasure from the ground, \nand only know where this object is by the tale of the princess. When your \nplayers stumble upon something like this, they love it.\n\n', 31, '2014-09-25 11:41:57'),

They are known to be particularly stalwart warriors and shrewd traders.\r\nGold dwarves are often trained specifically to battle the horrendous aberrations\r\nthat are known to come from the Underdark. Gold dwarves are stout, tough\r\nindividuals like their shield dwarven brethren but are less off-putting and\r\ngruff in nature. Conversely, gold dwarves are often less agile than other\r\ndwarves. The average gold dwarf is about four feet tall (1.2 meters) and as\r\nheavy as a full-grown human, making them somewhat squatter than the more common\r\nshield dwarves. Gold dwarves are also distinguishable by their light brown or\r\ntanned skin, significantly darker than that of most dwarves, and their brown or\r\nhazel eyes. Gold dwarves have black, gray, or brown hair, which fade to light\r\ngray over time. Gold dwarf males and some females can grow beards, which are\r\ncarefully groomed and grown to great lengths. Humans who wander into the gold\r\ndwarven strongholds may be surprised to find a people far more confident and\r\nsecure in their future than most dwarves. Whereas the shield dwarves suffered\r\nserious setbacks during their history, the gold dwarves have stood firm against\r\nthe challenges thrown against them and so have few doubts about their place in\r\nthe world.

Select 2 to enter the room description while in redit. When you enter \nthe room description for the first time make sure to type /c and hit enter to \nclear the current contents (You are in an unfinished room.) You edit the \nroom description in what is called the text editor. 	RHELP TEXT-EDITOR	n. \nLearn all of the text editor commands, they will be very useful.\n   Do not clone rooms without a specific reason. Saving time or energy is not \nan excuse. Players who play in zones with multiple copies of a description stop \nreading the descriptions. The zone becomes monotonous, and hence the MUD does. \nIf the MUD is boring, why play it? Why even build it? Changing a description by \none or two words counts as copying as well. Always keep in mind that the game \nis meant to be fun, so frustration, boredom, and irritation when reading \nsomething must be avoided at all costs. There are very few exceptions to this \nrule, and believe it or not, building a maze is -not- one of them.\n   In the room description itself, you should include the important things in\nthe room.  The next thing to consider is all of the long extra descriptions of \nthings you are going to enter. You were going to enter nice long text \ndescriptions of things, right? This is the new millennium and you are the \nculmination of centuries of evolution/creation and we cannot have zones like \nthe Sewers where half the rooms are: "This is a long, boring tunnel. This is \nanother long, muddy, boring tunnel."\n   Some players are evil, some are good, and many are not even human. When \nwriting descriptions be sure not to assume the nature of the character reading\nit. For example, do not say "The warrior towers above everyone in the room" when\nthe character looking at him might be a giant. Some players may be flying,\nsome may be near death, some may be high level and fearless in your zone, others\nlow level and easily killed. Do not assume fear, thirst, anxiety, etc.\nRemember mobs can be killed, move, or not load. Objects can be taken or not \nload, so never include them in the room descriptions.\nRoom descriptions must be at least 3 lines and no more than 13 lines (if \nyou run out of space use extra descriptions). Rooms with less than three lines\nare almost not worth creating in the first place, and more than 13 lines makes \nlife difficult for the reader, especially when just passing through.\n   If you feel you need a really long road, say the road is really long. A few \nrooms straight of a road or hallway or what not is pretty long. Do not feel the \nneed to extend it. Always include at least one interesting thing per three or\nso rooms. For example, have a bench in the garden or a table loaded to the \nroom. These objects do not have to do anything, just break up the sparse rooms.\nIf you are pressured to write bigger descs or make more rooms, relax. The best \nzones are usually very small and their size should not be measured by how many\ntimes someone has to enter w to go down the road, you can say something is any\nsize you feel like making it with words alone.\n\nSee also: TEXT-EDITOR\n', 31, '2014-09-25 11:41:57'),

That is annoying.)\n5) Fixed up some of the shops...shop 15102 is still a problem...but its\nfinally functioning which is an improvement.\n6) Erased old quest triggers that are not in phase with my current concept\nfor how the Zone should operate. Built some new ones that do conform\nto the new concept (I''ll explain that shortly.).\n7) Built a realistic blunderbuss with your appreciated help.\n8) Edited some of the Intro stuff in rooms 15100-15102.  \n* My original plan was to create something which people could actually\nuse to mud in the classical sense. But, I''ve rethought that a little.\nSince everyone comments that Tejas 1820 is unique...and maybe a bit\nalien, I''ve decided to make it into a more educationally-oriented\nenvironment by setting up "sector guide" mobs which interact with \nplayers and provide descriptive/directional info. The player asks\nfor help and those mobs provide it as best they can.\nI''ll also be adding one hack n'' slash area for players to do\ntheir usual thing...a Cantina. I''d initially intended to put\nin some authentic desert wilderness around my San Juan Bautista \nfort where players could go out and interact with the Apache\nthere and try to survive, but I''d rather allocate that Zone 82\nspace to completing my town. I think that adding wilderness \n(actual frontier wildlands) is going to require a third Zone\nwhen I get that far along. \nAs for the educational "sector guide" mobs...my big dilemma is\ntrying to figure out just what the players might want to know about \nTejas 1820. I can Speech trigger those mobs...but what would a\nplayer bother to ask them ? All of them are ICly-justified \nbilinguals or multilinguals in varying degrees of proficiency. \nBut, I need more feedback on what players would like to know about\nthe Zone environment.  \nMaybe the way to go is to set up little instructional Quests for \nthe players.

To do this the item must be added to the shops product menu.\nOtherwise the number of objects the shopkeeper sells will be the number in his\ninventory.\n   You can not use the same shopkeeper or the same room to make multiple shops.\n\nSee also: OEDIT-COST, SEDIT-PRODUCTS, SEDIT-MENU\n', 31, '2014-09-25 11:41:57'),

('stylistics', 'ELASETH STYLE', '	nunpublished work ?? 2000 Elizabeth Hoefling Last Modified: Feb 19th, 2004\n     	celaseth@@tbamud.com	n\n\n	cDisclaimer	n: The opinions herein belong solely to Elizabeth Hoefling. Some \ngames look for different things when building, but overall any zone made by \nthese rules should be good for most MUDs.\n\n	cThe Beginning of a Zone	n:\n\nThe first thing to do when sitting down to build a zone is just that - sit down\nand think about it. Every zone starts with an idea or a spark. From there, \ndevelop it. Pay attention to what kind of zone you want to create. Is it to be \nan exp zone? Gold/money? Equipment? Quest? A combination of each or something \nelse entirely? Evaluate the idea. Would you want to play in this zone?\n\nAfter you have this part worked out you''re ready for the second step, mapping \nit. Some really neat people prefer to map with graph paper, but that''s not \nnecessary. Any paper will do. The reasons behind mapping are simple. It \nsolidifies what you''re planning to build into mud terms. Also, though final \nproducts rarely are an exact copy of the map, they provide a concrete reference \nfor you to look at when the builder''s block question rears its ugly head "Hmm, \nwhat do I build next?" Lastly, not all players have nifty clients especially \nmade for mudding with auto-mappers, etc. We wouldn''t want those poor \nunfortunate souls to be at more of a disadvantage than they have to be... and \nmaps are highly important to knowing a mud, even if you keep them all in your \nhead as a few players do. \n\nWhen creating your basic map, it is also a good idea to number the rooms on your\nmap so you can keep track of vnums by the last two or three digits as well as \nknow exactly which room is where if you need to go back and change something. \nIt saves you having to dig through several vnums trying to find that one place \nwhere you have to reconnect an exit. Just create each vnum with the \ncorresponding map digits and it is smooth sailing.\n\nNow that you have an idea and a map, it is time to actually start building. And \nthis is where the term stylistics comes into play. These are the do''s and \ndon''ts of building that surpass simple knowledge of olc. Some of these rules \ndepend on the kind of mud you play, but most are tried and true for a nice, all\naround, every-mud-can-use-it zone.\n\n	cElements of Style	n:\n\nMost of us know that many players do not read descriptions, but that the mud \nenvironment would be ever better if people did. As builders, we want them to \nread because we''re not only putting a lot of work into what we do, but because \nthese descriptions and the areas they represent intrinsically represent the \nvirtual world of your game.\n\nAll descriptions should encourage players to read. First, by being well-written\nand simply bearing artistic merit. Second, by ensuring that they are absolutely\nnecessary to achieve the goals of the game! If your game is made for experience\nand equipment gathering, and failure to read descriptions directly impedes this\ngoal, then players will learn to read everything. If your game is made for \nexploring or role-play, most of your players probably already read them ? \nbecause knowing their environment is a basic requirement of play. In any case, \nbuilders exist to ensure that the goals of play are supported by game \ndescriptions.\n\nGame environments benefit from complexity, especially complexity that comes in \na palatable form (such as simplicity). There exists a certain pleasure in \ndiscovering depth anywhere, especially if it is truly a discovery. Hiding deep \nmeaning behind descriptions, areas to find, special items, unique nooks and \ncrannies to spend time socializing, and hints that point to these things \nelsewhere outside of your own zone is an excellent idea. In fact, if you \ndon''t wish to be building descriptions no one will read, you should employ \nspecial secrets ? most especially on games where knowing one''s environment \ndoes deeply affect a character''s development. No matter what kind of zone you\nare building, keep it interesting throughout!\n\nMost rooms or things that belong to a zone should play an actual part in the \nworld. If building a residence does nothing but add rooms, don''t bother adding \nit. It is entirely possible that small parts of the zone are there entirely for\nflavor, or to provide a place of a specific atmosphere to the game for certain \ntypes of play. This is fine, but make certain that your zone fulfills the \ngame''s basic design. Plain and simple, if these elements do not exist, the zone\nisn''t interesting and is not worth building. \n\nI suggest having something special every three or so rooms, even if it is only a\nminor addition that doesn''t even connect to the zone itself. Such as finding a \nsigil of office on a door, or old burned bones in a ditch on the side of the \nroad.\n\n	cStylistics - Rules and Explanations	n:\n\n1) Write complexity into your zone. If you don''t write well, you probably \n   shouldn''t be the sole builder of your zone. Instead, seek the assistance of \n   someone who adds creative merit to your descriptions. You can do practically\n   everything from plot to secrets to minutiae, even write the zone in full and\n   just ask someone you know who writes well to ?say it better'' and rewrite \n   what you intended to have there all along. Novels have editors, and so \n   should any zone.\n\n2) Add secrets! Reward players for participating in the game that the zone \n   represents. Always include at least one interesting thing per three or so \n   rooms. For example, have a bench in the garden or a table loaded to the \n   room. Many objects don''t have to do anything, just break up the sparse \n   rooms. A good amount of these things should do something to enhance a \n   player''s gaming goals, however, for the sake of forcing the player to read\n   what you''re taking the trouble to write.  Don''t forget to add difficulty \n   levels as well. Not all secrets should be highly difficult to discover. In \n   fact, most zone-defining secrets should be the easiest for a player to \n   discern and puzzle out, harder enigmas become the reward for replay or truly\n   deep thought, unnecessary for those of lesser time/intellect/interest to \n   simply relax and enjoy the game.\n\n     	cNote	n: Remember that gaming goals define a game, so H&S zones will want\n     to reward with good equipment or experience while RP games may wish to add\n     something social such as access to a special area their guild can take \n     over with relative privacy, etc.\n\n       	cRecommendation	n: document these somewhere for easy admin look-up.\n\n3) Never, ever repeat yourself. Do not clone rooms without a specific reason. \n   Saving time or energy is not an excuse. Players who play in zones with \n   multiple copies of a description stop reading the descriptions. The zone \n   becomes monotonous, and hence the mud based upon it shares that failure. \n   If a zone bores people, why play it? Much more importantly, why build it? \n   We''re talking about a great deal of work here. Changing a description by \n   one or two words counts as copying as well. If you feel that a teacher at \n   school would even consider calling your two descriptions plagiarism when \n   compared to each other, change them. Repetition is redundancy. Who wants \n   something they''re working on for several weeks to be seen as redundant?\n\n4) If a builder uses fantasy, they must make the relations necessary for \n   players to suspend disbelief.  Builders, of course, attempt to circumvent \n   reality and shape it to their will. Properly suspending a player''s \n   disbelief requires acceptable explanations for it to work, ones that allow\n   them to draw on their own experience and understanding of their environment.\n   For example, let''s say a player walks north and returns to find themselves \n   in a different place than where they left. Why did that happen? If this \n   isn''t something a player expects as a result of their actions, or a reason \n   hasn''t been offered to explain away the situation, the builder fails in \n   suspending disbelief. Instead, players think it is broken, or it is an OOC \n   attempt to screw them over, etc. So, if the physics of your world do not \n   match the physics in our world, inform your players through your \n   descriptions as to why their assumptions fail.\n\n5) If a zone is overly complicated, simplify it. Creating something that has \n   nothing to do with promoting zone''s purpose in which a player must solve to \n   gain anything from the experience only frustrates players. This does not \n   mean don''t make the zone complicated or difficult, but use good judgment as \n   to what is overly provoking to a player in a useless manner. A good rule to\n   follow is that if it is complicated and has nothing to do with a zone''s quest\n   or purpose, don''t make it necessary to achieve that purpose. My favorite \n   example for this "abuse" is adding secrets and failing to leave hints in \n   descriptions about how to solve or find them, such as a maze without even \n   telling the player why they''re in one or leaving any clue on how to solve \n   it. If they cannot achieve their goal without solving a puzzle, that puzzle \n   must be directly related to that goal.\n\n6) Rely on words to keep it interesting. Don''t feel the need to extend a zone \n   simply for the sake of scale. If you''re pressured to write bigger descs or \n   make more rooms, relax. The best zones are usually very small and a \n   description''s not limited to the number of times someone has to enter ''w'' \n   to go down the road- you can say something''s any size you feel like making\n   it with words alone. Remember, words are the main tool of describing things,\n   not special code effects, number of rooms, or colors. These things alone \n   never convey the feeling of a complete zone.\n\n	cThe Polish 	n(I.E. Picky Stuff)\n\n1) Do not use the word ''is'' in descriptions. It is generally accepted by the \n   literary community that the active voice is more powerful and eloquent. \n   Dodging the use of this word enriches descriptions in another way as well \n   as forcing you to use the active voice. It is easy to describe something as \n   it is red, it is big, it is heavy... and the word ''is'' becomes repetitive. \n\n2) Do not to use the word ''you'' in descriptions. It creates almost 90% of \n   direction bias and movement method errors, as well as the classic "telling\n   the player how to think or feel".  In any case, the small percent of \n   innocent uses of the word  ''you'' are easily written with other terms, and \n   getting used to writing descs without it means you don''t have to constantly \n   be on guard for these three blunders.\n\n3) Never tell a player how they feel. If you want a sad description, don''t tell\n   someone they''re sad, write the description to make them weep. The same goes \n   for scary, happy, disgusted, etc. You name it, make them feel it. Do not \n   simply say they are.\n\n4) Be extremely careful when building with color. Especially if you''re adding \n   it to your room descriptions. Try not to use more than one, and usually you \n   shouldn''t use them in the text at all, only in the room title. On objects \n   and mobs this rule is more relaxed, but if it is part of what the player \n   automatically sees when entering a room, it is probably best that it not be \n   too colorful and should only have 1 alternate color in it. Color is the \n   hardest thing for many good builders to learn how to use properly. Don''t be\n   disheartened or surprised if asked to change even a minor amount of color. \n   If you use color, -always- terminate the color correctly according to your \n   mud''s system.\n\n5) Never put a period at the end of a room title. Write all titles as you would\n   the title of a book, capitalizing all words except for a, the, and the few \n   excluded prepositions like ''of''. Short descs on mobs and objects should \n   always include the article or a measure word like ''some''. Long descs must \n   have the keyword of the object in it. In fact, it is usually best to write \n   the keywords -after- writing the short and long descs. A player should \n   never have to guess what the keyword is to affect an item. If they can see \n   it, they should be able to refer to it.\n\n6) Never describe a mob that''s loaded into a room in the room description, and \n   if the mobile is sentient (like a humanoid or race), it simply must be a mob \n   and cannot appear in the room description. An example such is butterflies \n   circling a bush. That''s fine if the butterflies are not supposed to be \n   sentient and are not loaded into the room. You should never describe drunks \n   at a bar in the room description of the bar, instead put them there as mobs.\n\n7) Always write extra descriptions and ALWAYS add at least one extra desc to \n   all objects including all of the general keywords so that the player can \n   look at whatever they pick up. Always. If your game supports a certain type\n   of description in addition to the typical ones, such as exit descriptions, \n   use them consistently.\n\n8) Any noun in the room description that cannot be adequately described should \n   either have an extra description in the room or outright exist as an object \n   to represent it.  This goes even if the idea of the object being of use is \n   a mere smokescreen. \n\n9) When building streets or any other generic structure with a name, give it a \n   meaningful or fanciful name. The Main Street is boring and overused in \n   almost all cities. Each city on a mud should have streets with unique names.\n   Same goes for the "Central Building" or " West Wall". \n\n10) If you describe an object, mob, or anything else in the room desc, do not \n    add it to the room and vice versa. This means if I describe a table in the\n    room desc, it should not be a visible object for the player to see in the \n    room. The reason for this goes back to the idea that you should never \n    ''repeat yourself''. \n\n11) Try not to describe objects that a mob is wearing in their look desc, and \n    never do it if you''re actually going to load the eq onto the mob. The \n    player will see it twice when looking at the mob.\n\n12) Do not write about the considerations of a player or thought processes. \n    Don''t ask questions in a room desc. Try to describe the looks of the mob \n    you''re writing about in the look-desc. The trick of making a mob say \n    something when looked at can be handled with scripts, and a player should \n    be able to see what they look at as if they''re doing so in real life.  \n    Remember that your job with descriptions is to create an interactive \n    environment that the player sees, hears, etc. This means that your number \n    one goal is to be eloquently descriptive, but to do it in such a way as to\n    simulate natural input as well as possible.\n\n13) Never just describe the important things in a room, always try to describe \n    the room in its entirety, given the acceptable space. Do not focus only on \n    the information a player needs to know. Things that are important, like \n    that special hammer, or the doorway behind the painting should be found not\n    because they are the only thing the player sees, but because of hints or \n    thought based on everything they see. For example, if I walk into a room \n    and see blank walls and a description that simply screams ''This object is \n    important, more important than anything else at all!'', people won''t think \n    on what they''re seeing and will lose a great deal of the point of \n    descriptions in the first place. In addition, do not do the opposite and \n    make something else seem of importance that is not while trying to hide the\n    true answer. Such misdirection will lead to player dissatisfaction... the \n    thing that we are trying to avoid wherever reasonable. \n\n14) Room titles should be original in nature. This means for the most part, do\n    not copy room titles. A person should be able to look, and by title alone, \n    know exactly where they are. There are exceptions (like roads), but try not\n    to make them too common, and you can break those room titles up with \n    prepositions, etc, as well. Ex: Thistledon Road by a Willow\n\n15) Room titles should pick out the most important thing in the room or give \n    the room a name to go by. For example, ''By a Patch of Daisies'' if daisies \n    are the most prominent thing or a name such as ''The Green Room''. Try not to\n    describe the title in the description of the room as the only item in the \n    room. In some cases, if the room has a name, try not redescribe the title \n    with the same words. For example, if the room title is ''By a Patch of \n    Daisies'' there really is little need to add the daisies to the room desc. \n    It is acceptable to do so, but be descriptive in these instances instead \n    of repetitive. \n\n\n	cRules of Practicality	n:\n\n1) Make sure the zone has a main goal. Every zone should have one before it is \n   built. If it is defeating the necromancer in the tower, setting the prices of\n   the local stables, giving someone a realistic role-play environment, or just\n   killing everything in sight, make sure you know what it is supposed to be \n   before you start building. \n\n2) Anything a player can see, he or she should be able to refer to. Be certain \n   that your keywords are intuitive.\n\n3) If a mob is not humanoid they probably don''t have money, and don''t go around \n   wearing all that much by the way of clothing. It is unrealistic for them to \n   have it, so don''t give it to them. If you want to reward the player for \n   killing them, give them a pelt, teeth, claws or something to be sold. See \n   rule #14 for more info.\n\n4) There should be between three and eight lines of text in a room desc. \n   Proper grammar should be used at all times in said text. Going over 8 lines \n   can be a bad idea because of the limit of player scrolling and how daunting\n   that amount of information becomes in a single dose. If a description \n   stretches too long, don''t hesitate to go back and cut points out to make \n   into extra descriptions. Extra descriptions improve zones, use them a great \n   deal! If a room does not have extra descriptions, it is not a worthwhile \n   addition to a zone.\n\n5) Do not use direction, movement, time or season bias unless the ability to \n   recognize these things is built into the game. If you can write \n   descriptions that will only be seen in winter, writing a winter description \n   adds to the game. If this isn''t possible, writing a winter description \n   detracts from the game, even if seasons aren''t coded. If they are \n   recognized, and you''re just too lazy to write descriptions for every \n   possibility, do not mention the possibility at all.  For a simple reminder:\n \n     Direction Bias: This means that when writing a description, don''t indicate\n     or insinuate that a player is going or looking in any one direction. An \n     example of a violation of this rule is "The castle lies before you in all \n     its glory..." The player may, after all, be leaving the castle, in which \n     case it would not be before them, but behind, making the description \n     unreal.\n\n     Movement Bias: when writing a description, don''t say "You are walking on a\n     path" because you never know, the player could be flying, levitating, \n     slithering, crawling, stomping, or anything in between.  \n\n     Time and Season Bias: when writing a description, don''t say "The sun \n     shines powerfully through the window" unless you can swap day descs for \n     night ones. At night, that desc is still the same, so the sun shouldn''t be\n     shining.  Seasonally, the leaves on a tree should not appear autumn reds, \n     browns, and yellows unless you can make that description only show during \n     that season.\n\n	cNOTE:	n If you would like to use this information for your game, you may do so\n        so long as you copy the entirety as is, keep Elaseth''s copyright label \n        at the top of it, and make any corrections as specific to your mud in \n        parenthesis.

('stylistics-2', 'STYLE-2 BUILDING GUIDELINES: ROOMS: - ROOM NAMES SHOULD BE UNIQUE', 'wherever possible, and be short, creative, and descriptive.  Never "A house".  \nInstead, "Inside a bustling, messy home".  Not "A road".  "A muddy, sogging,\nneglected highway."  Note that long roads and tunnels, etc, are the excep ion to\nthe rule about not repeating room names.  Always ask yourself "Is this creative\nenough?"  Often it is, but sometimes you can do better.  "A hot, dry, desert\nhighway" works, but it could have been "A sun-baked, elevated road above the\nsand" or somethi - Never use "you" in an rdesc.  "You feel a cool breeze."  No, I\ndon''t.  I''m undead and wearing full plate.  Instead, "A cool breeze blows across\nthe road, bringing with it the scent of melting snow."  You are allowed, however,\nto share what someone''s impress ons might be, if it helps establish setting.  \nExample: "This room in the inn looks far more worn and neglected than the\nothers.  Rat-eaten bedding indicates that whoever sleeps here isn''t very well\nrespected.  A pair of useless, worn-through boots have been - NEVER describe\nactions taken by the player in an rdesc.  "You wince at the sight of" "You step\non a rat" "You kick the skull in frustation" etc.  All bad.  Don''t do this.  \nThe player decides what the player does, NOT THE BUILDER.  - Rdescs should\ninclude all 5 senses wherever reasonable.  Remember, the purpose of an rdesc\nisn''t to hide a clue in a wall of text.  It''s to build setting.  Your players\nknow nothing about your world except what you tell them.  - Use adjectives.  Be\ndescriptive.  It''s not a chair, it''s a short-legged metal chair.  It''s not a\ntree, it''s a mighty, swaying cottonwood.  Tell me about the damn thing, if it''s\nso interesting you feel you should mention it.  On a related note, if it''s in th\nroom, mention it to build setting - Every noun in the rdesc should have an extra\ndescription.  There are exceptions, but that''s the rule.  If you introduce a new\nnoun in an extra desc, give that a new extra desc.  Let people feel like they\ncan explore every room in a more immersive way than wandering in and scanning\nfor mobs and items.  Let people "look book" "look chair" "look statue" etc.  -\nEvery exit needs a description, especially if it goes nowhere.  If I look down,\nwhat do I see?  What''s the floor made of?  Is there anything interesting about\nit?  Even if it''s completely plain, you can say something about it that builds\nsetting.  Example, ooking down: "Scuff marks mar the wooden floor around the\nlegs of the chair, indicating its frequent use" or, looking at up, "Signs of\nwater damage along the tops of the walls indicate the roof has gone without\nrepair for too long."  Mobs: - Remember that every mob you place has to have a\nreason for being there.  Mobs are part of the setting.  The mobs and the way\nthey''re described are incredibly important in establishing setting, especially\nfor people who don''t look at rooms.  - When designing a mob, ask yourself lots\nof questions like this: What is he doing here?  How does he interact with the\nenvironment?  How does he feel about that interaction?  What is he wearing, and\nwhat does that tell me about him AND about the setting?  B d mdesc: "A hairy\ngnoll glares at you."  Better mdesc: "A gnoll with long, braided hair and dark tan\nfur peers around the area, watching for interlopers.  His armor is a patchwork\nof metal scraps, and seems almost to have been assembled with the intention\nItems: -If an item is mentioned in an rdesc or mdesc, it should either be an\nextra description, or an item that loads in the zone.  -Show setting in your\nodesc.  Use it to describe not only the physical object in an informative way,\nbut also to talk about its place in the world, where applicable.  Example: "This\nshort, flat, knife is silver embossed with gold.  It usual place is on the utter\ntray of Cadaverian bourgeoisie at teatime."  \n\n', 31, '2014-09-25 11:41:57'),
('suggestions', '', '    	n (Written by Rumble of TBA) 	n Based on experience, a majority of\nnewbie builders seem to have the same set of problems.  	n First of all I''d like\nto say that while building can be fun it is also hard work, a lot of people who\nhave never built do not seem to realize it.  I have taught numerous people how\nto build.  They start on one small area usually 50 rooms or less, they are all\nexcited and gung-ho and get off to a good start but then somewhere along the\nline they realize: "hey, building is;not as glamorous as I thought, it doesn''t\npay, and it is actually very hard work."  Then they quit, which I respect more\nthan the ones who I teach how to build, give them an area, and they sit around\nmaking a "special room for themselves" or take advantage of the builder commands\nand equip themselves to the hilt or they sit around and complain because they\nare not promoted in the first week.  I do not ask for much from builders, I let\nthem build anything they want, if there is something special they want that is\nnot in the code we will put it in (as long as it is reasonable of course) I\ndon''t ask for long hours and I don''t sit looking over anyone''s shoulders, I\ndon''t even require a builder to have experience, I am more then willing to teach\nsomeone, what I am unwilling to do is let someone take advantage of me or my MUD\nwhich is mostly what I find happening with newbie builders.  I know I am\nrambling and I assure you I do have a point and here it is: *drum roll please* 	n\nBuilding is hard work!  It is a form of expression and creativity.  What kind of\nareas you build generally reflects on what kind of person you are.  You do not\nhave to be a good speller but you do need a good dictionary/thesaurus.  	n\nSometimes building can seem like a thankless job and sometimes building can be a\nreward in itself.  Building a few areas, even a few good ones, does not make you\nan Immortal or an Imp.  It takes more than building to be one of those and it\nentails even more work.  Respect others and they will respect you.  The more\ndetailed an area the better it is.  Always choose Quality over Quantity.  	n Put\nsome pride in your areas, develop a style of your own.  Try new things keep it\ninteresting, if you become bored with building an area take a break and play a\nmortal or do something else, don''t take advantage of builder privileges.  	n Treat\nothers as you wish to be treated.  One more warning I would give to builders\nbefore they take things personally or get insulted.  Everyone has their own\nideas on how to run a MUD, what it comes down to is whoever owns the MUD makes\nthe final decision, so it does not matter how good you think your idea is, it\nmay never be used if the owner does not like it.  Plain and simple.  You see\nthis on every MUD.  So please keep the ideas coming, but do not try to force\nthem onto anyone.  Be constructive, not critical about peoples ideas.  Everyone\nis allowed their opinions.  	n Be original, finish what you start, have fun, and\ndon''t forget to breathe!  	n\n\n', 31, '2014-09-25 11:41:57'),

('trigedit-advanced-examples', '', 'To add life to the worlds tbaMUD uses something called triggers. There are \nthree things in game that can have triggers attached to them: mobiles, objects,\nand rooms. Examples of common triggers include:\n\nCityguards screaming ''PROTECT THE INNOCENT! BANZAI! CHARGE!'', (a mob trigger).\nA portal that teleports players when they enter it (an object trigger).\nA room that creates a new exit when a player pulls a lever (a room trigger).\n\nEvery room, mobile, and object can have one or multiple triggers attached to it.\nThese triggers are activated by an event such as room entry, speech, commands,\netc. \n\nThere are several different types of triggers. Each trigger type determines\nwhen the trigger will be checked. For example, a mob speech trigger is checked\nevery time a character who is in the same room as the mob with the trigger uses\nthe ''say'' command. A room enter trigger is checked every time a character\nenters the room. There are two parts of the trigger used to determine if the\ntrigger''s commands are executed when it is checked, the argument and numerical\nargument (NArg). Some triggers use both; some may use only one of the two; and\nsome may use neither. The interpretation of these two fields is dependant on\nthe type, and is described in more detail with each triggers help file. 	RHELP\nTRIG-TYPE	n for a listing of all the trigger type help files.\n\nWhen an event in the game occurs, each trigger in the room where the event \noccurred is checked to see if there are any triggers which are supposed to\nreact to that event. Only one trigger of each trigger will be run by a single\nevent. For example, if there are two triggers on a trigger, and both are the\nsame type with the same arguments, the second trigger will only be run if the\nfirst one is already running. \n\nTriggers can be of more than one type. For example, to simulate a cursed item,\na trigger on the object could be of types drop, give, and remove. A more common\ncombined trigger would have both random and global types, so the random trigger\nwould be checked even when the zone was empty. Combined triggers must have the\nsame argument and numerical argument. \n\nThe other component of a trigger is the command list. This is a series of\ncommands that are executed when the trigger is run. Commands are chosen from\ntwo groups of commands, trigger specific commands and game commands. Triggers\nspecific commands are those commands that only the trigger interpreter can\nrecognize. These include flow control commands (such as if, elseif, else, end,\nhalt, wait, and return), and commands to manipulate variables (such as set,\neval, unset, and global). Game commands are those commands that a player could\nissue from their command line as well as special commands added for mobiles,\nobjects, and rooms such as wake, east, sit, etc.\n\nSee also: 	RTRIGEDIT-MOB-TUTORIAL	n, 	RTRIGEDIT-ADVANCED-TUTORIAL	n\n', 31, '2014-09-25 11:41:57'),

Doing this before\nworrying what can be done prevents you from limiting yourself to what you have\nseen other triggers do, and allows you to produce a more interesting trigger. \n  \nFor this example, I want to create a gate guard for a small walled town. The \nruler of the town has decided that each group of people will be charged ten \ncoins to enter his domain. The gate guard must notify travelers of the cost to \nenter, collect the money, allow people who have paid to enter the city, and \nclose the gate after them. This will be a mob trigger. \n  \nMake the mobs, objects, and rooms.\nSplit up the quest into simple sections.\nDecide what trigger types you need. 	RHELP TRIG-TYPE	n  \n   Our gate guard needs to react to four different events. These events are what\nwill cause the triggers to fire. Remember: a trigger requires a "triggering" \naction. i.e. speech, command, greet, etc.\n\n1. A character entering the room from the south needs to be told the price for \n   entrance. This will be a mobile greet trigger. 	RHELP TRIG-MOB-GREET	n \n2. When the guard is given ten or more coins, the guard must open the gate. This\n   is done by a mobile bribe trigger. 	RHELP TRIGEDIT-MOB-BRIBE	n I also want \n   the guard to give change and refuse entry for those without the money. \n3. When someone passes through the gate, the guard must close and lock the gate \n   behind them. This is done with a mobile act trigger. 	RHELP TRIG-MOB-ACT	n \n4. When the gate is opened from the other side, the guard must eventually close\n   it. This will be another act trigger. \n\nDetermine the arguments and the numerical arguments of the triggers from the help\nfiles. For the bribe trigger, the guard must respond whenever someone gives him\nsome coins, so Numeric Arg should be 1. The Act triggers should fire off "leaves\nnorth" and "the gate is opened from the other side."\n  \nWrite the body of the trigger.\nThis is the most complex and time consuming part. The valid commands and\nvariables are explained in the help files 	RHELP TRIG-COMMANDS	n and 	RHELP \nVARIABLES	n. Expressions are also used: 	RHELP EXPRESSIONS	n \n\nFor the greet trigger, I want the guard to inform anyone entering from the\nsouth how to get into the city. First, I must check if the character is\nentering from the south. If they are then the guard should tell the actor the\ncost of entry. 	RTSTAT 4	n\n \nUnder 	RHELP TRIG-MOB-GREET	n we see that the variable %direction% is set to\nthe direction that the character entered. The percent signs around any word \nmeans it is a variable and it can be found in 	RHELP VARIABLES	n. The two equal \nsigns together compares the value of the variable to the word "south" if these\nare equal the lines in the body of the if will be executed. The "wait 1 sec"\npauses the trigger for 1 second to allow the character to enter the room. (The \ngreet trigger is actually checked before the character enters the room. After\nanother brief pause, the guard announces the cost to enter the town. The\nindentations are not needed, but make it easier to read. You can auto-indent a\ntrigger by using /f or /fi. This is HIGHLY encouraged. Remember, every if needs\nan end!\n\nThe guard must open the gate if ten or more coins were given to him. 	RTSTAT 5	n\nAfter a brief wait (so everything doesn''t happen at once), the guard unlocks\nthe gate and opens it. The guard will close the gate after 10 seconds, even if\nno one passes through it. For the line "give %amount% coins %actor.name%", the \nvariables amount and actor are both set when the bribe trigger is called, these \nvariables are automatically substituted.\n\nFor the first act trigger, I want the guard to close and lock the gate after\nsomeone passes through the gate. The guard should wait briefly so he isn''t\nshutting the gate on the character''s back, then close and lock the gate. 	RTSTAT 7	n\n  \nFor the last act trigger we want the guard to close and lock the gate when it \nis opened from the other side. 	RTSTAT 8	n  The "wait 5 sec" gives time for \nsomeone on the other side to get through the gate. Next decide the order of the \ntriggers. The triggers are checked from first to last. If there are two \ntriggers of the same type, the first one run will be the only one run. \n\nThere are is one set of triggers which are the same type, the act triggers. \nSince both have arguments that will not occur together the order does not \nmatter. \n\nWrite the trigger.\nSimply use trigedit to create your trigger and they will be auto-saved for you\nwhen you exit the editor.

This example concentrates on \nquests involving mobs. \n\nThe process can be broken down to the following:  \n   1. Decide what you want the trigger to do.\n   2. Make corresponding mobs, objects, and rooms.\n   3. Split up the quest into simple sections.\n   4. Decide which trigger types you need.\n   5. Write the triggers.\n   6. Attach the triggers - permanently\n   7. Done ? \n   \n1. Decide what you want the trigger to do.  \n   In this example, we want to make a small mini quest in an area. The quest \nwill work like this: When you enter the room with the questmaster it will start\nto tell a tale. In this tale, you are instructed to perform a task. In this \ncase kill an ogre that lives nearby. As proof of the kill, you must bring back \nthe ogre''s wings and give them to the questmaster. \n\n2. Make corresponding objects and mobs.  \n      1 Questgiver mob - I''ve chosen ''the questmaster'' - vnum 14\n      1 Target mob - In this case ''a quest ogre'' - vnum 16\n      1 Quest object - ''a pair of wings'' - vnum 14 \n\n3. Split up the quest.  \n   Next thing to do is look at the different steps involved with the quest. In \nthis example, we have three steps: \n   Player entering room -> tell story \n   Player finds and kills ogre -> load object\n   Player gives questmaster the wings -> reward player \n\n4. Find corresponding trigger types.  \n   Having split the quest up it makes it easy to decide which triggers to use \nfrom 	RHELP TRIG-TYPE	n:\n   mob GREET trigger (attached to questmaster) 	RHELP TRIGEDIT-MOB-GREET	N\n   mob DEATH trigger (attached to ogre) 	RHELP TRIGEDIT-MOB-DEATH	N\n   mob RECEIVE trigger (attached to questmaster) 	RHELP TRIGEDIT-MOB-RECEIVE	N\n \n5. Write the triggers.  \n    Up to this point trigedit should not have been used. Most people struggle\nwith triggers because they have not planned what they want to happen or do not\nknow what trigedit is capable of. Read the help files of each type and ask for\nhelp if you need it. Remember, most of the work required with triggers is \nplanning! You must know exactly what you want to do before you do it. Now that\nwe know exactly what we want to do we can use trigedit.\n\n> trigedit 1\nTrigger Editor [1]\n\n1) Name         : 	yMob Tutorial Example Quest Offer - 14	n\n2) Intended for : 	yMobiles	n\n3) Trigger types: 	yGreet 	n\n4) Numeric Arg : 	y100	n\n5) Arguments    : \n6) Commands:\n	c* we don''t want him to tell this to mobs.

If a\nmobile enters the if check at the beginning will be false and the trigger will\nnot execute. Note how I named the trigger. ALWAYS include the VNUM of where you \nplan on attaching the trigger. Also, give it a name so it is easy to understand\nwhere it is used.

The last trigger just needs to check if the object handed over is \nthe correct one.

If it wasn''t the object, reject \nit, and use return 0 to prevent the object from leaving the players inventory. \nLastly, and very importantly, ''end'' the if. Every if must have an end.\n\n6. Attach the triggers - permanently  \n   Proceed and add the triggers to the two mobiles through medit: \n\n> medit 14\n[medit menu]\nEnter choice ?

Done ?  \n   The triggers are now attached to the correct mobs, and the players of your \nmud can now take the quest whenever they wish. This is a great time for \nconsidering improvements to the little quest: \n\nBalance issues: \n   Should players get a smaller reward if they perform the quest many times ? \n   Should it be limited to 1 quest per player or 1 per reboot ? \nGameplay issues: \n   Perhaps other mobs in town should tell the player to go see the questmaster ? \n   Should the ogre always load the object, or only when people know he has it ? \n   Are there other mobs who would like to pay for that object ? \n\nThe above list is just a few examples. All of them could be implemented, but \nit is beyond the scope of this tutorial. \n\n12DEC01 - original mob tutorial by Welcor\n02FEB06 - last updated/modified by Rumble\n', 31, '2014-09-25 11:41:57'),

First the list of local variables are checked to see if the variable\nis there. If not, the global variables are checked. A proper global match must\nhave a zero context or the current context of the trigger. (When a trigger starts\nrunning, its context is 0. The trigger context command may be used to change\ncontext.) If a match is still not found, a list of ''built in'' variables (ones\nnot declared by the trigger) are checked. If no match is found, the variable is\nreplaced with an empty string (the variable is removed from the line, and\nnothing added in its place).\n\nThere are two types of variables, local and global.

By default, the\ncontext is 0.

Please note that you must still have the required proficiency\nto use any weapon in that group without penalties.\n\nOn the subject of proficiencies, we''ve also added a weaponproficiencies command.  Typing\nit on its own will list each proficiency group.  To view what weapons are included in\nthat group, type ''weaponproficiencies (proficiency name).  For example, if you type\nthe command ''weaponproficiencies simple'' it will show all the weapons that are included\nwith the simple weapon proficiency feat.\n\nFinally, if you''re looking to get information on a specific weapon type, we''ve added the\nweaponinfo command.  Simply type ''weaponinfo (weapon name)'' and it will display all\npertinent information about that weapon.\n\nIf you are a staff member looking for the weapons creation help file, See: HELP WEAPON-CREATION.\n\n', 0, '2019-11-20 18:10:07'),

('you', '', '   Many head builders prohibit the use of "you" in any descriptions. This is\ndone because so many new builders use it incorrectly. A builder can and should\ndescribe everything without "you". But, in my opinion telling a writer not to \nuse certain words is like telling a painter not to use certain colors.\n   The key problem with using "you" is that it forces a player to think in \nyour terms, not the players. Do not think for the character. Instead, write\ndescriptions in such a way that they will cause the reader to think what you\nwould like all by themselves. Innocent uses of the word "you" are easily \nwritten in other terms, and getting used to writing descriptions without it \nmeans you do not have to constantly be on guard for the incorrect usage. \n  Do not describe a player''s emotions in the room, leave that up to your \ndescriptive text to evoke the emotions in the player, since that will make \nthings much more exciting to the player (do this by never using the word \n"you"). Some people believe that it is best to describe locations in the third \nperson all the time (i.e., never reference the player). \n   Never tell a player how they feel. If you want a sad description, do not \ntell someone they are sad, write the description to make them weep. Same goes \nfor scary, happy, disgusted, etc. You name it, make them feel it. Do not simply\nsay they are. Thinking for the character is one of the most common mistakes new \nand old builders make. Whenever you are tempted to write something that directly \nstates a character''s thoughts, actions, or reasoning ask yourself if it can be \ndone a different way (it always can). Do not ask questions in any description. \nRemember, a player should be able to see what they look at as if they are doing \nso in real life. \n\nHere are some examples of "thinking for the character" descriptions: \n \nBAD:  You shudder in fear as you look upon the evil statue of Marhuk!\nGOOD: The massive statue of Marhuk glowers down upon everything with an\n      awful malicious expression. \n \nBAD:  You proceed cautiously through the tunnel, weapon drawn.\nGOOD: The dark tunnel appears empty, but it is impossible to know what \n      might lurk just beyond the veil of darkness.\n \nBAD:  The dragon is large and looks very angry at you.\nGOOD: A massive dragon roars in anger, steam billowing from its nostrils.\n \nBAD:  You stand in a big room, it is very dark.\nGOOD: Shadows cower along the tall walls and almost seem to be moving. The \n      floor is made of heavy stones, which are very dark in color. The \n      ceiling is quite some distance above the floor, small objects hang\n      from it, ruining the smoothness that is characteristic of the rest \n      of the room.\n\nSee also: GRAMMAR\n', 31, '2014-09-25 11:41:57'),

You would simply go to the command options \nmenu and tell the zone file to load an object into the room. However, the object \nwill continue to load into the room, until it is maxed. To prevent 50 roses \nfrom loading into the room, simply hit N for new command. It will ask you where\nthe command should be placed. Use the SAME number as the command which loads \nthe rose. This will bump the command, which loads the rose down. Then you will\nbe at a command options menu. Enter R for remove an object from a room. If no \none comes along and gets the rose, the game will remove it and load another \none. This will prevent build up. \n   Zedit can not currently give a container to a mob and then load an object to\nthat container. A workaround for this is to load the object to the room before\nloading the mob. Then attach a load trigger to the mob that will force it to\npick up the loaded container.\n   Zedit is one of the tougher forms of OLC, and allows builders to cause \nerrors. Use common sense. DO NOT equip doors with objects. DO NOT close a \ndoor then lock it (just setting it locked makes it closed). DO NOT equip \nobjects. DO NOT put an object inside a mob. I can go on and on. But I would\nhope you can see the sense in all this. If you have a question ask. The \ndocumentation is all here, help is available. Just ask someone. PLEASE!\n   When loading mobs and objs through zedit the first loaded (zedit command 0)\nwill be the last listed in a room when it is looked at.\n\nMob loading through zedit is very limited in flexibility. Zone loading commands\nare saved in order by room number and the resulting list is simply run through\nline by line on zone reset. The problem with this is if you want to load 4 mobs\nin separate rooms there is no way to check if the mobs exist and where they are.\nThis results in the common problem of having towns with all the gateguards at \none gate. This can get complex, but say 4 guards are loading at the 4 \ncardinal gates: north, east, south, and west with a maxload of 4 in world. The \nload commands are also saved in the zone file in that order. On the first \nzreset you would have 4 guards at the 4 gates loading in order N, E, S, W. Then\nsay a player kills the guards at the E, S, W, gates, next zreset a guard \nloads at the N, E, S gates (2 now at the N gate). The same player kills the \nguards at the E and S gates. Next zreset mobs load at the N and E gates, and so\non. There is no "good" solution to this. It is simply a tradeoff in the code \ndue to the desire for simplicity. Most builders never need to worry about this.\nBut, if you do want more control on mob loading you can do it several ways. \nMake each mob unique, don''t reuse the same mob for each gate, and load only 1 \nof each. Or you can use trigedit to load the mob on zreset, checking if they \nalready exist. Both can be very time consuming.\n\nSee Also: FOUNTAIN, ZEDIT-ADVANCED\n', 31, '2014-09-25 11:41:57'),
